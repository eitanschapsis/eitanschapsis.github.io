            <p>I started my professional blog to give a new twist to Middle Eastern politics and show a different side that is more exciting and relevant to my field and studies: Public Relations. </p>
           
            <p>What does upholding international image have to do with PR you might ask? </p>
            
            <p><strong>Everything. </strong></p>
             
            <p>How other countries view each other affects international relations, business, treaties and even peace. In the Middle East, where fresh and relevant news comes out every day, upholding reputation is extremely important. The United States also has to uphold its reputation among not only Middle Eastern countries, but the world.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Image, reputation identity, positioning. </strong></p>
            
            <p>From Russian President Vladimir Putin writing in the New York Times to appease the American public, to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu getting caught in a Twitter twister, public relations is everywhere in politics and plays a pivotal role. Public relations can affect everything from a country’s viewpoint to its economy to election outcomes. Some say President Barack Obama owed some of his success to the massive Twitter and Facebook following he garnered over his campaign. </p>
            
            <p>This blog ties in all these ideas and relates them to a larger picture: </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>How will this affect the future of country to country diplomacy? </li> 
                <li>Could this escalate or will this just die down?</li>
                <li>How will this affect me where I’m living?</li>
                <li>Why is this even important?</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p>I hope this blog will spark an interest and revitalize enthusiasm in politics. Hopefully it will entice people to read more, judge less, research more and learn something. </p>

<h3>A Professional Interview:</h3> <p><strong>Dr. Dror Abend-David</strong></p>

<p>I had the pleasure of interviewing Dr. Dror Abend-David, a professor at the the University of Florida, about the differences in how different countries in the Middle East view media in the political sphere.</p>
            
<p>Dr. Abend-David "graduated with a doctorate in Comparative Literature from New York University in spring 2001. His first book, based on his dissertation, was published in 2003 by Peter Lang under the title ‘Scorned my Nation:’ A Comparison of Translations of The Merchant of Venice into German, Hebrew, and Yiddish. 

<p>His new book, Media and Translation: An Interdisciplinary Approach, is forthcoming in Summer 2013 with Continuum Press. He currently works on a book project that considers new readings of the poetry of Louis Zukofsky. In addition to his work on Hebrew and Yiddish Literatures, Dror published various articles about Media, Cultural Studies and Translation Theory, Modern Poetry and Drama." (Taken from <a href="http://www.languages.ufl.edu/faculty/abend-david.html" target="_blank">UF Languages Department</a>.)</p>

<p>Listen to the audio file below to hear the entire 14:22 minute interview. I hope you enjoy it and learn something new about the Middle East today as I did.</p>

<h3> My favorite quote from the interview:</h3> <p> In reference to Clinton- "You know Americans are obsessed with finding out the truth-It's obvious in that you'll get in trouble if you sleep with your intern, but in even MORE trouble if you lie about it."</p>
