            <p>I started my professional blog to give a new twist to Middle Eastern politics and show a different side that is more exciting and relevant to my field and studies: Public Relations. </p>
           
            <p>What does upholding international image have to do with PR you might ask? </p>
            
            <h4>Everything. </h4>
             
            <p>How other countries view each other affects international relations, business, treaties and even peace. In the Middle East, where fresh and relevant news comes out every day, upholding reputation is extremely important. The United States also has to uphold its reputation among not only Middle Eastern countries, but the world.</p>
            
            <h4>Image, reputation identity, positioning. </h4>
            
            <p>From Russian President Vladimir Putin writing in the New York Times to appease the American public, to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu getting caught in a Twitter twister, public relations is everywhere in politics and plays a pivotal role. Public relations can affect everything from a country’s viewpoint to its economy to election outcomes. Some say President Barack Obama owed some of his success to the massive Twitter and Facebook following he garnered over his campaign. </p>
            
            <p>This blog ties in all these ideas and relates them to a larger picture: </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>How will this affect the future of country to country                               diplomacy? </li> 
                <li>Could this escalate or will this just die down?</li>
                <li>How will this affect me where I’m living?</li>
                <li>Why is this even important?</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p>I hope this blog will spark an interest and revitalize enthusiasm in politics. Hopefully it will entice people to read more, judge less, research more and learn something. </p>
